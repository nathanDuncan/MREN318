1.1) Explain the working principles and some applications of the GP2Y0A02YK0F 
(https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Infrared/gp2y0a02yk_e.pdf)
  Working Principle
    GP2Y0A02YK0F is a distance measuring sensor unit,
    composed of an integrated combination of PSD
    (position sensitive detector) , IRED (infrared emitting
    diode) and signal processing circuit.
    The variety of the reflectivity of the object, the
    environmental temperature and the operating duration
    are not influenced easily to the distance detection
    because of adopting the triangulation method.
    This device outputs the voltage corresponding to the
    detection distance.
    
  Applications
    Touch-less switch
    Sensor for saving energy
    Amusement equipment

1.2) Explain the working principles and some applications of the HC-SR04
(https://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/HC-SR04-Ultrasonic.pdf)
  Working Principle
    "The basics of using ultrasound are like this: you shoot out a sound, wait to hear it echo back, and if you have your
    timing right, youâ€™ll know if anything is out there and how far away it is."

  Applications
    Car Parking Reverse Sensors
    Liquid Level Detection

2) How are these two sensors similar?
  Both operate on the same generic principle of sending a signal, having it reflect back and then measuring distance 
              Distance = speed*Tof/2
  They mainly differ in the type of signal used for detection.
  THEY ARE NON-CONTACT!!!!
  They include a transmitter and reciever
  They are low cost
  They are both applied as proximity sensor 
  THEY ARE BOTH ACTIVE SENSORS
